"""
    The Problem class. This is where most of the problem-specific logic (e.g. 
    the problem formulation) is done. For this problem in particular, we need
    two attributes: the city map and the test case (a Search Request). The 
    city map contains all the information related to the underlying navigation
    problem, while the Search Request includes all the info related to one
    specific search (e.g. starting point, targets locations, etc.). It is the 
    job of the Problem class to put these two together to generate the states,
    actions, transitions, costs and heuristics needed for search.

    """
        The constructor. A new instance of the Problem class should be used
        for every new search that will be executed.

        Use the information from map and test case to generate the 
        Initial State for the current search problem.
        
        Hint: current_case has information about both the starting location
              and the search nodes.

        Check if the given state object represent a goal state. This can be
        determined using information stored in the state itself and also
        in the current_case object. 
        
        Hint: Keep in mind that the goal state requires the driver to be back 
            at the same location where the trip start, and all targets should 
            have been visited.

    """
        Given a state, this function generates a List of the Children states.
        This function basically implements the transition model. First, you 
        need to consider which locations are neighbors of current location 
        (the map class can help with that). Actions here are equal to travel
        to any of these immediate neighbors. For each of these actions, you 
        will have to generate a new state object. Keep in mind that some of 
        these locations might be part of the targets. As such, your state 
        generation process needs to correctly update the vector of visited
        nodes for the child state. 
        
        Hint: This function needs to use the city_map, the state, and the
            search_case. 
        Hint: Mind the alignment between target locations in the Search Request
            object and visited targets in the State object.

        Hint 2: The city map can give you the info you need about costs of
             traveling between neighboring locations.
        Hint 3: Do not confuse this with the straight line traveling distance
