"""
    The SearchTreeNode class. This class represents the individual nodes of a 
    Search Tree. Every node is linked to its parent. Each node holds the action 
    used at the parent node to reach the current node, and also the total cost 
    of the path from the root to the node. We do not need to connect the nodes 
    to their children because the tree is constructed in a top-down fashion, 
    keeping references to all leaves (e.g., the frontier), and once that a goal
    state is explored, we simply navigate the path from the Node holding the goal
    state back to the root of the tree to generate the final solution 
    (e.g., an action sequence). 
     
    Note that this class is enough for implementing different search algorithms.
    We might create a SearchTree class, but we really do not need it. Also, This
    class is very generic, it is totally independent of the problem. All data 
    related to the problem itself is stored on the linked State object.  
    
    In addition, a "node id" attribute is included. This attribute is just a 
    simple correlative which counts how many nodes have been created so far. 
    This attribute is used as the default key for sorting elements of this 
    class. That is, this is the attribute used to determine if a given node is
    "smaller" than another in the "__lt__" method (the method called when you 
    do "a < b"). However, SearchTreeNodes should be sorted externally using the 
    priority criteria that corresponds to each search algorithm. If after using 
    these criteria, two nodes still have the same priority, then the tie will 
    be broken by node id. In other words, the node that was created first will
    have the highest priority (FIFO) for those ties.
