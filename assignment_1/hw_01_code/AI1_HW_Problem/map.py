    This class is used to represent the Map of a city (part of the underlying problem).
    It includes information about the city name, the locations of interest in the map, 
    with their known 2D position. It also includes connectivity information that can be 
    used to determine if a location can be reached from another, and what is the 
    corresponding cost (distance in miles). The relative scale represents the value that
    was used to convert the raw distances between 2D points in the map to miles.
