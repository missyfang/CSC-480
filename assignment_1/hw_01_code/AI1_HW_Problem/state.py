"""
    The State class. This class is problem-specific.  It is used to represent 
    a Single State (a node) of the State Space.
    
    For the delivery problem, this class includes:
    - The current location of the simulated driver
    - The status of each target that needs to be visited
    
    Note that the Search Request class includes the concrete list of locations 
    to visit. The visited_target attribute includes a list of boolean values 
    which must be aligned with that list of locations. Every value represents if 
    a target location has already been visited (True) or not (False). 
    
    For example, 
       if a search requires visiting locations ['F2', 'A2', 'K3', 'X4', 'D2']
                         and visited_targets = [True, False, False, True, False], 
       that would mean that locations 'F2' and 'X4' have been visited already, 
       and that 'A2', 'K3' and 'D2' are still pending.
    
    Note that the locations in the Search Request object are NOT sorted (this is 
    completely intentional). These locations simply follow whatever order that 
    was used in the original test case file. This order should not have any effect 
    on the search process. 
    
    Finally, the atomic attribute keeps an "atomic representation" of the whole
    state, which is required for keeping records of the nodes that have been 
    reached and explored.
