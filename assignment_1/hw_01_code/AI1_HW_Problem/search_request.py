    This class is used to represent a Search that needs to be executed. 
    Each search has a name used to identify individual test cases.
    Each search begins from a specific location (the start point), it
    requires visiting a list of targets (a list of locations) and a 
    valid solution must end with the driver being back at the starting 
    location.
